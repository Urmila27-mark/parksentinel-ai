# ParkSentinel AI — Theme 1: Parking-Induced Congestion

Flipkart Gridlock 2.0: Team SoloRider (Urmila)

A working prototype for AI-driven parking intelligence: detecting illegal-parking
hotspots and quantifying their impact on traffic flow, using the official BTP
violation dataset.

| Folder | What it is |
|---|---|
| `core_analysis.py` | Single source of truth for all EDA, junction recovery, and CPS logic. Imported by both the notebook and the dashboard so they can never drift out of sync. |
| `notebooks/eda_and_cps.ipynb` | Full exploratory analysis, narrated step by step, including the timezone bug we caught and corrected. Already executed — outputs are saved in the notebook. |
| `streamlit_app/` | The live dashboard. Run with `streamlit run app.py`. |
| `cv_pipeline/enforcement_logic.py` | Real geofencing (point-in-polygon) + dwell-time tracking + evidence generation logic — the "after detection" half of the proposed CV pipeline. |
| `data/` | The dataset (gzip-compressed, ~14.8MB), plus exported intermediate CSVs (`junctions_scored.csv`, etc.) produced by the notebook. |

## Quickstart

```bash
cd streamlit_app
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Opens a 6-tab dashboard:
1. **Overview** — violation breakdown, rejection rates, repeat offenders
2. **Time Analysis** — the corrected (and, for comparison, the original incorrect) time-of-day pattern
3. **CPS Rankings + Heatmap** — live, interactive Coverage Priority Score ranking and geospatial heatmap
4. **Clustering Cross-Check** — unsupervised k-means on the same four CPS features, with no fixed weights, as an independent check on whether CPS's priorities are data-supported or just an artifact of our chosen weights
5. **Junction Recovery** — recovers the ~49.5% of rows with no junction tag via lat/long nearest-match
6. **Enforcement Demo** — a live, adjustable geofence + dwell-time simulation

You can also upload a *different* BTP-format CSV from the sidebar and every
number on the dashboard recomputes live against it.

## Reproducing the EDA

```bash
cd notebooks
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace eda_and_cps.ipynb
```

This regenerates `data/junctions_scored.csv`, `data/hourly_distribution.csv`,
and `data/rejection_by_type.csv` from scratch.

## Key findings (all reproducible from `core_analysis.py`)

- Only **1.44%** of all violations are captured 3pm–midnight IST; **81.68%**
  fall between 3am and 1pm. The raw timestamps are in UTC — reading them
  without converting to IST (UTC+5:30) produces the opposite, misleading
  picture. See the Time Analysis tab's toggle to reproduce that mistake live.
- Manual-review rejection rate is **24–36%** across every violation category —
  a measurable, pre-existing accuracy ceiling in the current pipeline.
- **~49.5%** of rows have no junction tag despite having usable lat/long;
  of those, only ~11% are within 500m of a known junction — most genuinely
  aren't near any of the 169 curated junctions, which is itself a finding
  about the limits of that junction list.
- Junction ranking by CPS meaningfully disagrees with ranking by raw violation
  count — see the "rank improvement" table in the CPS tab for concrete examples.
